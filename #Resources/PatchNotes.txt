# Modern User Interface Update

The days of spending a lot of time setting up the encoder are gone, here are the days of simplicity! With this update both advanced interface are now one allowing for faster setup, easier control and better overall support. Some of the properties have also been simplified to be less overwhelming. The best of it all? You don't lose any control over any feature, you can still use all of them if you need to.

There are also a few property changes that come with this update:
You can now control how strict the VBV Buffer is when automatically calculated, Keyframe Interval supports sub-second precision now, CABAC is no longer considered experimental and GOP Size was removed (controlled by Keyframe Interval). Most of the properties also now have a tooltip that directly explains what it does, with certain ones even including recommended settings and supported values.

The internal encoder part has also been updated for better hardware support, better crash resistance, runtime version tracking and is now also following proper AMF code guidelines as requested by MikhailAMD. Logging has also been changed severely for the better and should allow for massively easier supporting down the line.

And with all that said, here is 1.4.0.0 in all it's new shiny glory. 

## Notes

Due to the nature of changes in this update, your previous settings may end up lost or incorrect. Make sure to revalidate them before attempting to record or stream.
