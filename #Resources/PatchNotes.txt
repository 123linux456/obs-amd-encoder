# Modern User Interface Update

The days of spending a lot of time setting up the encoder are gone, here are the days of simplicity! With this update both advanced interface are now one allowing for faster setup, easier control and better overall support. The best of it all? You don't lose any control over any feature, you can still use all of them if you need to.

There are also a few property changes that come with this update: You can now control how strict the VBV Buffer is when automatically calculated, Keyframe Interval supports sub-second precision now, CABAC is no longer considered experimental and GOP Size was removed (controlled by Keyframe Interval). Most of the properties also now have a tooltip that directly explains what it does, with certain ones even including recommended settings and supported values.

Some internal changes have also been made that allow for better support down the line. At startup the plugin will print the correct version information for the Runtime (trackable down to the individual driver release), some log messages were rewritten and supporting people are now informed when you are using a configuration that disqualifies you from being supported.

And with all that said, here is 1.4.0.0 in all it's new shiny glory. 

## Notes

Due to the nature of changes in this update, your previous settings may end up lost or incorrect. Make sure to revalidate them before attempting to record or stream.
