# 1.3.0 - The AMF SDK Path

It has been a long time since we've seen a version without any attachments to the number, hasn't it? But now is finally the time! We've come a long way since 1.1.2, going through two rewrites, one to make it easier for me and one to update to a new SDK - and it was worth it. Now we have arrived at a plugin for OBS Studio that manages solid 4K at 60 fps while still being light on the CPU side.

### Notes

Before installing this Version, please uninstall any previous versions. If you used the installer, it is as simple as using the Uninstaller entry it created. If you extracted it, you will need to manually remove the extracted files.
