A small hotfix that reverts an earlier change in preset code, fixes a buffer size bug, improves overall threading performance and finally makes OpenCL useful.

### Notes

Before installing this Version, please uninstall any previous versions. If you used the installer, it is as simple as using the Uninstaller entry it created. If you extracted it, you will need to manually remove the extracted files.

### Changelog

* Fixed: OpenCL with Host Memory Type will now no longer work and instead log an error.
