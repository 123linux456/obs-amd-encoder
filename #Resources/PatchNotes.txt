Ever wanted to change your settings mid-stream or mid-recording but had to previously stop the stream or recording for that? You no longer have to do this, as I have just added support for complete reconfiguration during encoding to the plugin - now you can adjust while testing.  

There is also now a Profile Level called 'Automatic' which will use the best Profile Level for the given Frame Rate and Resolution - all presets will now use this instead. Many presets have been updated with better overall settings and will now perform better - and no presets will override Advanced or Expert settings anymore.

I hope that you like using this encoder as much as I enjoy creating it. I have never worked this closely with AMD before and it is simply amazing how fast my bug reports have been fixed now. Let us hope that all of them can be fixed and then Two Pass and HEVC will make an appearance.

### Notes

Before installing this Version, please uninstall any previous versions. If you used the installer, it is as simple as using the Uninstaller entry it created. If you extracted it, you will need to manually remove the extracted files.
