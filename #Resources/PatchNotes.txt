1.3.0 - The AMF SDK Path

AMD updated the SDK and the plugin shall follow in it's footsteps. With this new SDK (an an actual documentation) the plugin can now finally be more accurate in it's usage - no more guesswork.

**Notes**

Before installing this Version, please uninstall any previous versions. If you used the installer, it is as simple as using the Uninstaller entry it created. If you extracted it, you will need to manually remove the extracted files.

**Changelog:**

* Changed: Loading of required libraries was changed to match AMF documentation.
* Changed: Shared Encoder is now using new Library linking class and was rewritten from the ground up.
* Added: In depth AMF tracing to the OBS log files, allowing me to spot bugs much faster than before.

**ToDo:**

* Advanced Encoder update.
