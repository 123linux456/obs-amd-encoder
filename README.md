This is a plugin for the [Open Broadcaster Software](https://obsproject.com/) project that adds support for AMD Hardware Encoding through the use of [AMDs Advanced Media Framework](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/AMF).

Starting with Open Broadcaster Studio Version 0.16.2, this Plugin replaced the old Media Foundation Transform based approach (which causes issues and slowness). Due to this, Open Broadcaster Software Studio is now a better choice than the old Open Broadcaster Software Classic VCE branch.
